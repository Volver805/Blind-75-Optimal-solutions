This is a straight forward problem all we have to do is to implement a min heap

1. intialize our minimizing heap `h`
2. iterate on each node and store its value in our heap
3. intialize our head node `head` that we will return as an output and `node` for iteration
4. while the heap is not empty create a new node and pop the top element from the heap and use it as a node value
5. return `head`
